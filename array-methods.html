  <h1>Array Medthods</h1>
  <h4>at()</h4>
  <section>
    <span>The at() methos takes an interger value and retruns the item at that index, allowing for positive and negative integers.</span>
    <span><strong>Negative integers count back from the last item in the array.</strong></span>
    <section>
      <p>This is not to suggest there is anything wrong with using the square bracket notation.</p>
      <span>For example array[0] would return the first item. However instead of using array.length of latter items; e.g. array[array.length-1] for the last item,</span>
      <span><h2>you can call array.at(-1)</h2>
    </section>
      
      <code> 
       const arrayOfvalues = [5,12,8,130,44];
      let index =2;
        console.log(`Using an index of ${index} the item returned is ${array1.at(index)}`);
      // expected output: "Using an index of 2 the item returned is 8"

      index = -2;

      console.log(`Using an index of ${index} item returned is ${array1.at(index)}`);
      // expected output: "Using an index of -2 item returned is 130"
      </code>
